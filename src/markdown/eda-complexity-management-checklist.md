Here is a practical checklist you can use to assess and improve how you manage complexity in your Event-Driven Architecture.

> ⭐️ **Pro-Tip:** Pro-Tip: Here’s how to get real power from this list. A checklist that lives on a wiki is just a document; a checklist that runs in your CI/CD pipeline is a safety net. Your goal should be to translate as many of these points as possible into automated tests that run on every build. For instance, make your pipeline fail if a new event-consuming service is added without a DLQ configuration, or if its logs aren't structured JSON. This turns architectural standards from suggestions into enforceable, living policies.

### Observability Foundation

- [ ] **Correlation IDs:** Is every event published with a unique correlation/trace ID in its headers?
- [ ] **ID Propagation:** Does every service automatically extract an incoming correlation ID and include it in all its logs and any outbound events it produces?
- [ ] **Structured Logging:** Are all services configured to output logs in a structured format (e.g., JSON) rather than plain text?
- [ ] **Centralized Logging:** Do you have a centralized platform where you can search, filter, and analyze logs from all services in one place?
- [ ] **Distributed Tracing:** Are your services instrumented for distributed tracing (e.g., using OpenTelemetry)? Can you visualize an end-to-end flow for a typical business process?
- [ ] **Business Metrics:** Are you emitting metrics that correspond to key business outcomes (e.g., orders_processed, shipments_initiated) and not just technical ones?
- [ ] **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Are you monitoring the health of your message broker (e.g., queue depths, consumer lag, error rates)?

### **Resilience and Fault Tolerance**

- [ ]  **Idempotency:** Are all your critical consumers idempotent? Do you have a clear strategy (e.g., tracking processed message IDs) to prevent duplicate processing?
- [ ]  **Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs):** Do your critical consumers have a DLQ configured to catch "poison pill" messages that cannot be processed?
- [ ]  **DLQ Alerting:** Do you have automated alerts set up to notify the responsible team when a message lands in a DLQ?
- [ ]  **Retries:** Do your consumers implement a retry strategy for transient failures?
- [ ]  **Exponential Backoff & Jitter:** Does your retry strategy use exponential backoff with jitter to avoid overwhelming a recovering service?
- [ ]  **Timeouts:** Have you configured sensible timeouts for all network calls to external services or databases?

### **Process and Choreography Management**

- [ ]  **Saga Identification:** Have you identified the key long-lived business processes (sagas) in your system?
- [ ]  **Choreography Mapping:** Have you documented or visualized the event flows for your most critical sagas? Do you know which service publishes what and which service consumes it?
- [ ]  **Compensating Actions:** For each step in a saga that makes a change (e.g., reserving inventory), is there a corresponding compensating action defined and implemented (e.g., releasing inventory)?
- [ ]  **Failure Scenarios:** Have you tested the "unhappy paths" for your sagas? What happens if a compensating action fails?
- [ ]  **Event Versioning:** Do you have a strategy for versioning your event schemas to handle changes without breaking consumers? (e.g., using a schema registry).
- [ ]  **Event Documentation:** Is your event-driven architecture documented using a standard like AsyncAPI to provide a clear, machine-readable contract for each service?
